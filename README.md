Welcome to T-DESIGNER project 



## Running the server
1)Start MySQL. Will create an empty database on first start
Command on terminal: $ mysql-ctl start

2) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

3) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9users.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
